PART I — THE TELEVISION

See the television.

It is being carried up from a truck in Chattanooga. Heavy. Older than it looks. The woman takes it by the corners the way you take something that once spoke too loudly. She moves carefully, though the danger has long since passed.

This is the television she watched her father die on.
She does not turn it on.

Later—earlier—it hums in a basement in Georgia.

The room is low and cool. Cinderblock walls. Carpet worn flat where children have sat and waited without knowing what for. Four boys sit close. Knees touching. Someone’s heel hooks under the couch. The adults are upstairs. Their voices drift down in fragments. The house is occupied but unattended in the way that matters.

The screen glows blue. It fills the room without warming it.

On the television, the world is happening elsewhere. Distance arranged so it can be watched. Images repeat themselves, not because there is nothing new to show, but because what is being shown cannot yet be finished.

A woman appears on the screen. She is watching something herself. Her posture is still. Her attention fixed. She does not look away.

The boys do not speak. No one tells them what they are seeing. The television hums, steady and obedient, doing exactly what it was built to do.

The child feels it then.
Not fear.
Pressure.

Something has crossed from outside to inside. Not an image. A rule. The room feels slightly too small for what it now contains.

This is where orientation begins.

Much later, the woman sets the television down in a new room. She wipes dust from the glass with her sleeve. She stands there a moment longer than necessary. Then she steps away.

The screen stays dark.

PART II — THE ROOM

The news reaches the school before it reaches the words for it.

Classes stop without instruction. Teachers stand in doorways longer than necessary. The bell does not ring. Children are gathered and moved down hallways in loose lines, their names called, then called again.

They end up in the multipurpose room.

The walk there takes longer than it should. Shoes squeak on linoleum. Someone trips and laughs too loudly, then stops. Teachers move with clipboards held against their chests, unsure where to place their hands. Doors close softly behind them, as if sound itself needs to be managed. The hallway feels narrower with each step, as though the building is drawing inward around whatever has entered it.

It is a room meant for many things and built for none of them well. Folding chairs. A low stage. Flags posted where they are always posted. The ceiling higher than it needs to be. Light coming in from windows too high to look out of.

The children sit. Knees forward. Hands in laps. Some swing their feet. Some hold them still. No one knows what to do with their eyes.

An adult speaks. Then another. Words are offered carefully, as if they might break if dropped. Someone suggests prayer. No one argues. Heads bow unevenly across the room.

This is how the world tries to steady itself.

The child bows his head because everyone else does. He hears breathing. Shuffling. A cough held back too long. He does not pray for anything in particular. He is listening for the feeling from the basement to return.

It does.

Not louder. Clearer.

Something has happened that cannot be carried by one house alone. It has moved into rooms like this one. Into shared air. Into silence arranged by authority.

After the prayer, no one moves right away. Heads lift unevenly. A few children keep their eyes closed longer than necessary. An adult clears a throat and does not speak. Chairs shift, then still. The room waits, suspended between what has been said and what cannot yet be resumed. This is the pause where alignment is tested—not privately, but together.

When the prayer ends, no one knows what comes next. The room remains full. The world does not resume. It has only paused, waiting to see where it will be asked to stand.

The child stands when he is told. He walks when the line moves. He learns that alignment is sometimes communal, and sometimes not.

He remembers the rule.

PART III — IRV CRENSHAW

Irv Crenshaw believes in alignment. Not as an idea, but as a practice repeated until it becomes instinct.

He rises before the sun. Coffee made the same way each morning. Shirt pressed. Shoes placed where they will be found again. He keeps his life ordered so that attention can be given elsewhere.

He works with systems—numbers, instruments, schedules. He understands that order is not control. It is care extended over time. When things are aligned, fewer people get hurt.

Years earlier, at the University of Georgia, he learned how to stand inside institutions without letting them speak through him. The country was loud then. Lines were drawn. Voices demanded allegiance. Irv chose posture instead. Straight. Still. Facing forward. Not neutral—anchored.

This is where he meets Martha Odom.

They recognize each other immediately, though neither says so. She carries time differently. He carries responsibility. Between them forms a shared discipline: how to move through power without being bent by it.

Later, Irv works in a tower. Height without spectacle. From above, distance clarifies. You see sooner. You speak earlier. You keep your voice level so others can keep theirs.

He believes in this work.
He believes it is enough.

He does not imagine himself at the center of anything. He is a man positioned where he is needed. He trusts that if he stands correctly, the rest will follow.

Outside, the morning continues to arrive.

PART IV — MARTHA ODOM

Martha Odom does not rush the morning. She listens to it first. Light comes through the window at a familiar angle. The house settles around her. She knows the difference between quiet and absence.

She has moved through rooms that were not designed with her in mind. She learned early how to read a room before entering it, how to stand without asking permission, how to let time do some of the work. She does not mistake survival for surrender.

On the table sits a record still wrapped in plastic. New. Forward-facing. Someone brought it by late the night before, proud of the timing. It waits there, unopened.

Martha reaches past it.

She puts on Otis Blue. The needle drops. A voice fills the room that has already lived through what it sings. There is grain in it. Breath. Space between notes. The sound does not hurry her.

She listens the way she has learned to listen—to calibrate. Not for prediction. For placement.

Martha’s hands rest easily at her sides. They have learned what not to do. They have signed papers, steadied others, held weight without displaying it. She does not fidget. She does not reach for what announces itself. Years have taught her that restraint is not denial but precision—knowing exactly where not to apply pressure.

Otis has always been there for her. Not this record in particular, but the sound itself—the frequency of a voice that has already passed through trouble and come out legible on the other side. She keeps it close the way some people keep scripture, returning to it not for comfort, but for orientation. It reminds her where the human scale is.

At the University of Georgia, years earlier, she and Irv Crenshaw learned this without naming it. How to remain legible to yourself when institutions grow loud. How to stand close enough to influence without being absorbed. Their bond was never dramatic. It did not need to be. It was made of mutual recognition and long attention.

Martha carries memory forward, not as grievance but as ground. She knows that history lives in the body first. That alignment is not something you declare. It is something you practice until it holds.

The record plays through.
She dresses.
She leaves the house.

Outside, the day is already underway.

PART V — THE TOWER

Irv Crenshaw is drafting emails when the instruments shift.

Nothing alarms at first. Numbers hesitate. A tone he has learned to trust changes its weight. He adjusts his posture. He reads again.

He writes carefully. One message about the weather. One about schedules. One meant for the children. He chooses words that can stand on their own. He leaves room where certainty would be dishonest.

In the tower, height does what height does. It removes excess. Panic has nowhere to hide. You speak early. You keep your voice level so others can keep theirs.

When the plane enters the frame, it is already aligned with what it will do.

Irv understands this without surprise.

He steps out of his body as a man steps aside to let something pass. There is no struggle. No bargaining. Only the continuation of posture beyond muscle and breath.

From where he stands now, there is no tower.
No screen.
No broadcast repeating itself.

There is only motion completing motion.
East meeting West.
Steel finding morning.

Below, in a school multipurpose room, children bow their heads.
Below that, in a basement in Georgia, a television hums.

The screen stays on.
The signal finishes its work.

The emails remain unfinished.
Which is how orientation is handed down.
