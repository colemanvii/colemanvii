    <div class="prose">
      <p><strong>Coleman VII</strong> is a creative studio focused on narrative clarity and long-term meaning. The work spans brand storytelling, visual systems, editorial direction, and cultural narrative—shaped with restraint and intention.</p>

      <p>The studio was founded and is led by <strong>Cole Calfee</strong>, a Southern artist and writer whose personal practice is divided between fine art, writing, and creative direction. Coleman VII serves as the applied, client-facing extension of that practice—translating presence, slowness, and coherence into collaborative work.</p>

      <p>Projects are developed deliberately, with an emphasis on continuity over trend and signal over noise. The studio works selectively and favors partnerships built on trust, patience, and shared values.</p>
