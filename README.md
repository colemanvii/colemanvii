I work slowly.  
I care about language, attention, and what lasts.

This space is a record of things tended over time:
notes, systems, fragments, experiments,
and work meant to stay coherent rather than loud.

I’m interested in:
- alignment over acceleration  
- depth over display  
- tools that protect the human signal  

Some things here are finished.  
Most are not.

That’s intentional.
